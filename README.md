TurboCAD is an advanced design and drafting environment built for users who demand precision, flexibility, and high performance in technical drawing and modeling. It goes far beyond basic CAD tools by offering a full suite of professional features, making it suitable for architects, engineers, mechanical designers, product developers, and educators.  

This platform provides a versatile workspace where both beginners and experts can handle 2D drafting and 3D modeling with ease. Unlike minimalistic drawing apps, TurboCAD includes associative dimensioning, constraint-based modeling, customizable tool palettes, and extensive libraries that cover architecture, mechanical engineering, and general design needs.  

The software has been continuously enhanced to fully utilize the power of Apple Silicon processors (M1, M2, M3, M4), resulting in faster rendering, smoother 3D navigation, and better performance on large-scale projects. Its ability to work natively on modern Apple devices ensures that professionals can rely on it for long-term productivity.  

TurboCAD is also widely recognized for its compatibility. With support for DWG/DXF, IGES, STEP, STL, and 3DS, it integrates seamlessly into workflows where collaboration with AutoCAD, SolidWorks, and other platforms is essential. Whether youâ€™re creating blueprints, mechanical prototypes, or 3D product models, TurboCAD ensures that your work remains accessible across industries.  

Another strong point of TurboCAD is its adaptability. The interface can be tailored to personal workflows, making it efficient for those who switch frequently between architectural layouts, engineering schematics, and conceptual 3D designs. The parametric toolset and intelligent snapping reduce repetitive tasks and increase drafting speed, while advanced rendering engines make it possible to generate photorealistic visualizations directly within the program.  

Beyond professional use, TurboCAD is also valuable in educational settings. Universities and training centers use it as a cost-effective yet feature-rich alternative to more expensive CAD suites. Students benefit from exposure to professional-grade tools, while institutions reduce licensing overhead without sacrificing functionality.  

### Key Features:

* Accurate 2D Drafting & Annotation capabilities.  
* Full 3D Modeling & Surface/solid design toolkit.  
* Specialized architectural and mechanical modules.  
* Optimized for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4) with major performance boosts.  
* Broad compatibility with DWG, DXF, IGES, STEP, STL, 3DS.  
* Advanced rendering system with customizable materials and lighting.  
* Parametric Constraints for precise engineering workflows.  
* Customizable interface and automation with macros.
